Privacy Policy
Last Updated: January 9, 2026

Overview
Catholic Calendar ("the App") is designed with your privacy in mind. This privacy policy explains how the App handles your information.

Data Collection
We do not collect any personal data. The App does not:

Collect personal information
Track your location
Use analytics or tracking services
Send any data to external servers for tracking purposes
Create user accounts or profiles
Use cookies or similar tracking technologies
Data Storage
All data created by the App is stored locally on your device:

Calendar preferences (diocese selection, notification settings) are stored in your device's local storage using Apple's SwiftData framework
Liturgical calendar events synced to Apple Calendar are stored within Apple's Calendar app on your device and/or your iCloud account, depending on your Calendar settings
Network Requests
The App connects to a backend API solely to retrieve liturgical calendar data (feast days, holy days, etc.) based on your selected diocese. These requests:

Do not include any personal identifiers
Do not track or log user behavior
Only transmit the diocese and year needed to fetch the appropriate calendar data
Third-Party Services
Apple Calendar Integration
If you choose to sync liturgical events to Apple Calendar, the App uses Apple's EventKit framework to create calendar entries. These entries are governed by Apple's privacy policy and your iCloud settings. The App does not access any existing calendar data beyond the calendars it creates.

Apple Push Notifications
If you enable notifications, the App uses Apple's local notification system to remind you of upcoming liturgical events. These notifications are scheduled locally on your device and do not require any data to be sent to external servers.

Children's Privacy
The App does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age. The App is suitable for users of all ages.

Data Sharing
We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect any data.

Your Rights
Since no personal data is collected or stored on our servers, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete. All App data stored on your device can be removed by deleting the App.

Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.
